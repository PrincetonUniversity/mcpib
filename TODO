Infer lambda types when passed to Callable::addOverload

Direct storage of function objects instead of std::function.

Make it unnecessary (but still possible) to pass TypeRegistry
to Callable::addOverload.

Improve error messages in conversion failures (include type and function names).

Test reference and pointer conversions (once we have class wrappers).
